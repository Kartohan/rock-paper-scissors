# rock-paper-scissors
This time i trying to write a basic game, that takes a much more time that i expected. I still have things to learn.<br>
~~23.04.22 - Game works only in the console <br>
08.05.22 - Game works with prompt. 1.0 version (yay)~~<br>
~~08.05.22 - UI was added. Still can add some features but the result works well (2.0 ver) <br>~~
22.05.22 - UI changed to more informative. Changed icons and add gamefield where you can see the player and computer results. (2.1 ver) <br>
I want to add modal in the future.

~~*Reminder: i need to complete this game because it is still didn't work like i want to*~~
