# rock-paper-scissors
The common Rock Paper Scissors game. I have learn a lot of this throught this lesson. My code it still messy but every day i try to write cleaner code.<br>
~~23.04.22 - Game works only in the console <br>
08.05.22 - Game works with prompt. 1.0 version (yay)~~<br>
~~08.05.22 - UI was added. Still can add some features but the result works well (2.0 ver) <br>~~
~~22.05.22 - UI changed to more informative. Changed icons and add gamefield where you can see the player and computer results. (2.1 ver) <br>
I want to add modal in the future.~~
31.05.22 - Add modal (finally). Add phone version. Now you can play the game from the phone! (2.2 ver) <br>
To be honest, i copied most of *Modal* code from the [W3Schools Modal Lesson](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp) but i read throught the lesson and understand how to do it on my own.

~~*Reminder: i need to complete this game because it is still didn't work like i want to*~~
