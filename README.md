This time i trying to write a basic game, that takes a much more time that i expected. I still have things to learn.<br>
23.04.22 - Game works only in the console <br>
08.05.22 - Game works with prompt. 1.0 version (yay)<br>

~~*Reminder: i need to complete this game because it is still didn't work like i want to*~~
